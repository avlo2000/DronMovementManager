Part I (Done)

General:
	Firs part of poject is a library which provides creating of any material object as enumeration of material							
	points which are fixed relative to one another and points of attachment of force(approximately two weeks).							
																																	
Entities:																															
	Point - provides an abstract point for further implementations	;																
	MaterialPoint - point which has mass and movement vector ;																
	ForcePoint - predetermines point of attachment of force and current vector of force	;											
	Object - provides enumeration of points which interact with each other	;	

Note:
	All entities are ideal physical model. No heat losses or external forces are included. The system is ideal.
																																	
Purpose:																															
	Create the API providing further aims: work with material objects of different forms; then create an object which is identic to	
	the experimental object and test simulation of its movement; then create console controlling of simulation 						
	and logging of imortant events.

Part II 

General:
	In this part of project the physical model of sattelite will be created.

Entities:
	ReactionWheel - inherited from MaterialPoint, is used for changing rotation speed of sattelite by changing its angular momentum ; (Done)
	Sattelite - inherited from Object, provides simulated Settelite of arbitrary form, which moves and rotates using  (Done)
				thrusters(ForcePoint) and reaction wheels;
	Simulator - provides enumeration of Objects and configuration of scenario of their behavior ;
				
Note:
	In ReactionWheel is included friction force as speed loss(meters per second).
	In Sattelite is included force of gravity it can be set as a constant vector.

Purpose:
	Create library which provides creating and simulation of sattelite. Include there heat loss external forces.

Part III

General:
	In this part of project the library which provides simulation of sattelite will be used in Simulator and created: data representer 
	for training AI module; data generator using Simulator; Sattelite that has rotation wheels.
